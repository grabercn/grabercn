Hi there! I’m a student at the University of Cincinnati Studying Computer Science. 
I love working with multiple languages such as python, C++, and Javascript. 
I’m passionate about creating software that is both efficient and user-friendly. 
In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies. 

Feel free to check out some of my work.
